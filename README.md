In the Studies in Python repository, my goal is to learn and build on my own wealth of knowledge regarding the necessary skills for data science/analysis in Python, 
with a focus on understanding how libraries essential to the above work on their own and in concert, and share what I learn. Sources I find useful to this end will, 
naturally, be credited and praised for their work and will, in general, be free (though Coursera is a great source too).

I hope this repo will be useful for others at the beginning of their journey into Python for DS/A, and that those more experienced might find some enjoyment in
contributing to a large store of knowledge. 

As the purpose of this project is educational, there is no strict end-goal in terms of functionality. As such, kindly ENSURE that any pull requests made conform
to the general principles of 1) clarity, 2) educational-value, and 3) commentary -- code with explanatory comments is much appreciated. 

Thank you for your time in reading or contributing.
