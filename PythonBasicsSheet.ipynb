    "To Shashank Kalanithi, whose warmth, courage to err and correct, knowledge, and hours of labor have gone into producing dozens of videos and Notion Documents on data science and analytics, from theory to technique -- all taught masterfully -- thank you.\n",
    "\n",
    "I produced this notebook as a repository for my own understanding and plan to add to it as I learn more. I hope it might serve a similarly useful pedagogic purpose to others at the beginning of thier Python journey, and that those with greater expertise might correct any errors or misapprehensions they notice to help create a useful set of references that future us will be happy to have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of it is based on Shashank's video \"Python for Data Scientists and Data Analysts\"; I strongly encourage you to support him in any way you can and make use of the explanations, documents, and courses he produces. I have found them to be invaluable resources and trust that anyone wanting to brush up on their knowledge or learn the fundamentals will as well.\n",
